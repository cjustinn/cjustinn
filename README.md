### :wave: Hi, I'm Justin!

---

I am a recent graduate from the [Computer Programming & Analysis](https://www.senecacollege.ca/programs/fulltime/CPA.html) program at Seneca College, in Toronto, Canada :canada:. I have been interested in, and passionate about, technology and development for as long as I can remember, and I am always excited and enthusiastic about learning new things and technologies.

Through college, I found myself particularly interested in both backend and cloud development, but I am also interested in learning more about virtually all areas of development and technology.

### :computer: Technologies, Languages, and Platforms
Through my college education, high school courses, and personal learning, I have experience with a good number of technologies, platforms, and languages. As somebody who loves to learn, and play around with both familiar and unfamiliar languages, frameworks, etc., in his free time, I look forward to expanding the list below as I gain more professional and personal experience.

Below is a list of technologies that I have experience with (along with some others):
